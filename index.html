				<h3>Major Reasons for Population Decrease:</h3>
					<h4>Suburbanization</h4>
						<p>Following World War II, people began leaving cities for the new
							housing found in suburbs. The construction of the Interstate System,
							which began in the 1950s, allowed people to easily commute to their city jobs from their new
							homes. </p>
					<h4>Deindustrialization</h4>
						<p>The decline of the industrial sector led to severe population
							loss, as well as economic decline. Industries that saw major decline
							following World War II include steel (affecting Pittsburgh and Gary, among others)
							and the auto industry (affecting Detroit and Flint). The term "Rust Belt"
							was soon created to to refer to the area of the United States where
							where deindustrialization was common; an area covering part of the Northeast
							and Midwest, near the Great Lakes.
						</p>
					</div>
				<h3 style="page-">Major Reasons for Population Increase:</h3>
				<h4>Locations of Growing Industries</h4>
				<p>Many cities experiencing exponential growth are homes to industries that
					have also seen much growth since 1950, including, but not limited to, the technology, oil, tourism,
					and banking industries. These cities also have diversified economies, unlike many of <thead>
						Rust Belt cities which were dependent on one industry.
					</thead>
				<h4>Climate and Geography</h4>
				<p>Each of the "growing" cities featured on the map on the right are in
					southern half of the United States; they each have a warmer climate than
					the "declining" cities. This contributed to the increase of permanent residents,
					and the growth of the tourism industries in some of these cities. The desirable locations
					of a few of these cities (for example, San Diego's location on the West Coast,
					and Phoenix's desert surroundings) also help boost tourism.
